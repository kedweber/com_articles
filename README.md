# com_articles

## Introduction

This package is a reimplementation of com_content. It is part of the Moyo CCK and this is the place that stores articles.

**Note**: Please note that `com_articles` is currently at version 2.1.X. Version 1 is not supported anymore, since CCK
items are being stored in an altogether different way.

See [the Moyo web site](http://moyoweb.nl/) for more details.

## Requirements

* Joomla 2.5 or 3.X .
* Koowa 0.9 or 1.0 (as yet, Koowa 2 is not supported)
* PHP 5.3.10 or better
* Composer
* Moyo Components
    * com_cck
    * com_kutafuta
    * com_moyo
    * com_makundi
    * com_routes
    * com_taxonomy
    * com_terms
    * com_translations

## Installation

### Composer

Installation is done through composer. In your `composer.json` file, you should add the following lines to the repositories
section:

```json
{
    "name": "cta-platform/articles",
    "type": "vcs",
    "url": "https://git.assembla.com/cta-platform.articles.git"
}
```

The require section should contain the following line:

```json
    "cta-platform/articles": "2.*.*",
```

Afterward, just run `composer update` from the root of your Joomla project.

### jsymlinker

Another option, currently only available for Moyo developers, is by using the jsymlink script from the [Moyo Git
Tools](https://github.com/derjoachim/moyo-git-tools).

## Usage

### Administrator backend

Since `com_articles` is part of the Moyo CCK, you can *not* use the content menu in the admin backend of Joomla. Instead,
go to 'Components >> Articles'. The articles view looks like the familiar com_content view, yet cleaner. Most notable is
the translations column that displays the translation status per language.

The article form is a major refactor of the `com_content` version. The screen is divided into five sections:

* **Content**
    * **Title**: self-explanatory
    * **Subtitle**: self-explanatory
    * **Slug**: autogenerated. Useful for routing.
    * **Fields**: Contains a select2-box of possible fieldsets for `com_articles`. Please note that form will auto-update
    on changing this value, which will destroy any current data. Use with care
* **Details**: Publish dates as per Joomla 3.X.
    * **Published**: Sets publishing status.
    * **Translated**: Sets translation status.
* **Meta**: Metadata as per meta-tags in HTML
    * **Description**: Sets the value for the meta `name="description"` tag.
    * **Keywords**: Sets the value for the meta `name="keywords"` tag.
* **Relations**: Sets predefined relations with other Moyo CCK items. These may vary per project.
    * **Category**: Sets the `com_makundi` category.
    * **Tags**: Set the `com_terms` tags.
    * **Regions**: Sets regions for which an article is relevant. Makes it easier to filter by region.
    * **Topics**: Sets topics for which an article is relevant. Makes it easier to filter by topic.
    * **Further reading**: Sets an article-article relation.
* **Fields**: Contains all fieldset-specific fields.

### Frontend

In the frontend, there are three views:

* **Articles** Shows an article list as per the given parameters. As of the time of writing, JSON, HTML and RSS are supported.
* **Article** Shows a single article as per its fieldset.
* **Frontpage** Frontpage view for articles.

### Modules

There is a module that displays an article as a Joomla! module. You can add it by choosing 'Articles' as module type.
Choose the article and you are set.

## Notes

* In order to make articles translatable, you must install the `com_translations` component.
* The stock search plugin does not work for our CCK. Instead, install `com_kutafuta`.
* Articles are categorized through `com_makundi` and `com_taxonomy`. The stock `com_categories` is not compatible.
* Joomla routing is less than complete. Therefore, `com_routes` is an explicit requirement for `com_articles` to work.
